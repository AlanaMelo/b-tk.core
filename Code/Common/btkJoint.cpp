   * @class Joint
   * @brief Class to define a joint, defined by a proximal and distal segment.
   *
   * A joint is supposed to have 6 DOFs, so without any constraint.
   * To define a joint between a segment and the global frame, you have only to define
   * global frame as an empty segment (i.e. use btk::Segment::Pointer()).
   * For example, to define the joint "thorax" between the global frame and the trunk you can use the 
   * following code:
   * @code
   * btk::Segment::Pointer trunk = btk::Segment::New(Segment::Trunk, Segment::Central, "Trunk", "");
   * btk::Joint::Pointer thorax = btk::Joint::New(btk::Segment::Pointer(), trunk,"Thorax", "Joint between the global frame and the trunk")
   * @endcode
